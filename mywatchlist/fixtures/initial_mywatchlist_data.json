Of course it would take Sam Raimi to find the perfect blend of comic-book-movie, horror, fantasy and slapstick. He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off."

The actors are great too. You find yourself running home to see the next episode. Of courses there are great performances to pull all this off."

That's a powerful scene. It's a scene of a reality that is more powerful than most other family-friendly animated movies are willing to go. It's the step that puts this onto another level."

I got into it, because of it's massive Impact on the anime community as a whole and how it bends the rules of traditional anime and makes me laugh and sob at the drop of a checkered hat. Stories in traditional \"shonen\" or \"for boys\" anime fall into obvious tropes that JoJo does not. Normal anime will follow a main character (mostly male) trying to solve a problem through fights. JoJo follows that guideline with some major improvements."

It is even better than Firefly (another of my favorite series), ten times over. It is an utter shame that lazy critics never took the time to actually watch this spectacular series before reaching into what could only be drawers-full of unpublished reviews, picking a negative one at random and calling it their two cents."
